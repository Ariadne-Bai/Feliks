# Feliks
data abstraction and persistence for public transit with attributed graph

# A Proof-Of-Concept Prototype
The Simulation Engine run an simulation of mixed discrete-event and discrete-time style simulation, and emits `Nodes` and `Edges` to a graph database(Neo4j) everytime an `Event` (state change for agents) occurs in the system.

# Note
`feliks` folder contains the main code, `feliks-neo` and `feliks-aura` are for database testing purpose.
